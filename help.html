have extracted the professional (Psy-Q) libraries and made them
usable with a modern GCC compiler and debugger. They are also
maintaining the PS1 emulator <a target="_blank" class="urllink"

through code. And they have combined all these projects into a
simple Visual Studio code extension. </p>
<p class="vspace">Net Yaroze, being a cut down version of the
professional SDK, it is relatively simple to create a Net Yaroze
compatible project. </p>
Follow the most excellent video instructions to get started.

<p class="vspace">Run the Psy-Q Cube template demo first as per
the video. Make sure it builds, runs and step debug correctly.
Installing clangd is also recommended. <br>
</p>
<h3 id="PSX.DEV_Net_Yaroze_project">The Net Yaroze template.</h3>
<p>This Net Yaroze template requires the Psy-Q and nugget tools,
if you ran the Psy-Q Cube demo, there's nothing else to install.<br>
The instructions are the same as per the Psy-Q Cube demo:<br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Code, hit <b>CTRL + Shift + P</b>, select PSX.DEV
Show panel, click the TEMPLATES tab. </li>
<li>Enter the name and path of your project and click Psy-Q SDK
tab, then click create in the Net Yaroze section, to create
the new template project.</li>
<li>The Net Yaroze template copies the Psy-Q SDK (libraries and
headers) in the project folder, with the modified <a
href="https://github.com/gwald/psyq_to_netyaroze"
moz-do-not-send="true">Net Yaroze headers</a> and creates a
demo program <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/gwald/netyaroze_demo/blob/main/tutor/chap2/9/main.c">originally




from


here</a>. It should automatically load the new project into
Visual Code.<br>
</li>
<li>Now we are ready to run and debug, Hit <b>CTRL + Shift + P</b>
and select <b>PSX.DEV: Build Debug</b>, it should build
correctly with no warnings or errors, and a XXX.ps-exe file,
(where XXX is your project name) should have been created. </li>
<li>Hit <b>CTRL + Shift + P</b> again and select <b>PSX.Dev:
Launch </b><b>PCSX-Redux</b>, this will launch the emulator
but it will not start. </li>
<li>Return to Visual Code and hit <b>F5</b> to start the
debugger, step over a few lines and loop through the <i>while(




!DONE


)</i> loop, put a break point after the <b>if(
PAD_PRESS(buffer1,PAD_UP) )</b> line at<b> sprite.y -=5;</b>&nbsp;




about


line 86. <br>
</li>
<li>Next click run, to return to the step debugger, simply hit
the up button on the controller. <br>
</li>
<li>Close the emulator to stop debugging. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Changing the linker settings.</h3>
<br>
The Net Yaroze linker setting are defined typically like:<br>
<b>-Xlinker -Ttext -Xlinker 80090000 </b><br>
<br>
Where 0x80090000 is the RAM location that the executable is loaded
to.<br>
<br>
In PSX.DEV the default is 0x80010000 (PSX RAM address range is
from 0x80010000 to 0x801fffff).<br>
Loading at 0x80010000 is a problem for Net Yaroze programs because
that's the location of the Net Yaroze libps.exe file (like a DLL
which makes executables smaller to transfer over serial - See
Memory Map in the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://archive.org/details/net-yaroze-documents/020-1997-userguide/page/38/mode/1up">Net



Yaroze


User Guide PDF</a>).<br>
We need to change it to the first RAM available to us, which is
after libps.exe, 0x80090000 (loaded low).<br>
To do this with PSX.DEV's GCC, add this line as the first LDFLAGS
line in the makefile: <br>
<b>LDFLAGS=-Xlinker --defsym=TLOAD_ADDR=0x80090000 <br>
<br>
</b>But the executable can be loaded anywhere in the PlayStation's
RAM. For example the executable can be loaded after the assets or
data files, loaded higher in RAM. <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Replicating the Net Yaroze Siocons script.</h3>
<br>
Siocons is a DOS terminal program which can send and receive data
from the Net Yaroze after it has load the Net Yaroze boot disc.<br>
It can mostly be automated by using a batch script file (typically
.sio, .auto or .bat) which loads data files to the PlayStation at
specific RAM addresses. Maintaining these addresses sequentially
and saving space is a pain and it's recommended that the siocons
script file be automatically generated using a tool like <a
moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://github.com/gwald/YOC">YOC</a>
which also creates a header file. <br>
<br>
This siocons script is also used by <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/gwald/Yarexe">yarexe</a> to package all
the files into a single PS-X executable file, which makes it
easier to run, burn etc.<br>
<br>
<p class="vspace">In a real Net Yaroze project, you would load
your data assets into RAM via the siocons script, in PSX.DEV the
debugger has to pre-loaded the assets into the correct RAM
address when pressing F5. This is done via <b>.vscode\launch.json</b>
in your project folder. </p>
<p class="vspace">You would add your assets a similar way to the
siocons script, ie: <br>
<br>

<b> </b><b> </b>local load y3d.ps-exe<br>
go</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="vspace"><br>
In the <b>.vscode\launch.json</b> file, the <b>autorun</b>
section, the above equivalent would be:<br>

<h3> Reusing asset RAM</h3>
If you only load your assets once in your program (which is
typical for Net Yaroze) and you organize your files correctly,
then after they have been copied to their respective places ie
TIM's to video RAM and VB's to audio RAM and initialized
correctly, their original RAM space can then be reclaimed by your
program for anything, ie game logic etc or by initializing the
heap (via InitHeap) to start at the top of this RAM space (which
then grows upwards).<br>
<br>
Obviously you can not reclaim RAM space of files that are still
required to be in RAM, ie TMD's.<br>
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
<h3>Tips &amp; Notes<br>
</h3>
<p class="vspace">Psy-Q requires the libGS libraries to be
initialize with a GsInitGraph call <b>FIRST</b> before using
other libGS functions, in particular FntLoad.<br>
</p>
<p class="vspace">Modern GCC can be very strict, make sure all
your functions that return a value, does return a value, this is
especially true when debugging using GDB.<br>
</p>
<p class="vspace">Both FntPrint and KanjiFntPrint prototypes were
empty in libps.h this was incorrect and are correctly defined
as:<br>
int FntPrint(int id, char *, ...);<br>
int KanjiFntPrint(int id, char *, ...);<br>
<br>

</h3>
<p class="vspace">The Psy-Q to Net Yaroze glue (psyq_to_netyaroze)
is still Work In Progress.<br>
There are a few things missing or not working, these are
typically:<br>
</p>
<p class="vspace">1) Compiler built-in functions (exit, abort,
etc) - If you come across a C language function that doesn't
work, test it in the Psy-Q Cube demo to verify it works first,
if it doesn't work or is wrongly defined, then it could be a <a
moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget">Psy-Q conversion</a>
issue;</p>
<p class="vspace">2) or Net Yaroze only helper functions like
TestCard, GetPadBuf which are not found in Psy-Q.<br>
