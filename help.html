have extracted the professional (Psy-Q) libraries and made them
usable with a modern GCC compiler and debugger. They are also
maintaining the PS1 emulator <a target="_blank" class="urllink"

through code. And they have combined all these projects into a
simple Visual Studio code extension. </p>
<p class="vspace">From early testing, it does not support float's
or any functions which uses them. </p>
<p class="vspace">Net Yaroze, being a cut down version of the

<p class="vspace">Run the Psy-Q Cube template demo first as per
the video. Make sure it builds, runs and step debug correctly.
Installing clangd is also recommended. <br>
</p>
<h3 id="PSX.DEV_Net_Yaroze_project">Basic PSX.DEV Net Yaroze
template instructions.</h3>
<p>This Net Yaroze template requires the Psy-Q and nugget tools.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Code, hit <b>CTRL + Shift + P</b>, select PSX.DEV
Show panel, click the TEMPLATES tab. </li>
<li>Enter the name and path of your project and click Psy-Q SDK
tab, then click create in the Net Yaroze section, to create
the new template project.</li>
<li>The Net Yaroze template copies the Psy-Q SDK (libraries and
headers) in the project folder, with the modified <a
href="https://github.com/gwald/psyq_to_netyaroze"
moz-do-not-send="true">Net Yaroze headers</a> and creates a
demo program <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/gwald/netyaroze_demo/blob/main/tutor/chap2/9/main.c">originally




from
here</a> and it should automatically load the new
project into Visual Code.<br>
</li>
<li>Now we are ready to run and debug, Hit <b>CTRL + Shift + P</b>
and select <b>PSX.DEV: Build Debug</b>, it should build
correctly with no warnings or errors, and a XXX.ps-exe file,
(where XXX is your project name) should have been created. </li>
<li>Hit <b>CTRL + Shift + P</b> again and select <b>PSX.Dev:
Launch </b><b>PCSX-Redux</b>, this will launch the emulator
but it will not start. </li>
<li>Return to Visual Code and hit <b>F5</b> to start the
debugger, step over a few lines and loop through the <i>while(




!DONE
)</i> loop, put a break point after the <b>if(
PAD_PRESS(buffer1,PAD_UP) )</b> line at<b> sprite.y -=5;</b>&nbsp;




about
line 86. <br>
</li>
<li>Next click run, to return to the step debugger, simply hit
the up button on the controller. <br>
</li>
<li>Close the emulator to stop debugging. </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Changing the linker settings.</h3>
<br>
The Net Yaroze linker setting are defined typically like:<br>
<b>-Xlinker -Ttext -Xlinker 80090000 </b><br>
<br>
Where 0x80090000 is the RAM location that the executable is loaded
to.<br>
<br>
In PSX.DEV the default is 0x80010000 (PSX RAM address is from
0x80010000 to 0x801fffff).<br>
Loading at 0x80010000 is a problem for Net Yaroze programs because
that's the location of the Net Yaroze libps.exe file (like a DLL
which makes executables smaller to transfer over serial - See
Memory Map in the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://archive.org/details/net-yaroze-documents/020-1997-userguide/page/38/mode/1up">Net



Yaroze
User Guide PDF</a> which is up side down).<br>
We need to change it to the first RAM available to us which is
0x80090000 (loaded high), so add this line as the first LDFLAGS
line in the makefile: <br>
<b>LDFLAGS=-Xlinker --defsym=TLOAD_ADDR=0x80090000 <br>
<br>
</b>But the executable can be loaded anywhere in the PlayStation's
RAM. For example the executable can be loaded after the data files
(loaded low). Some of the data that has already been moved to
other RAM types (TIM's to video RAM and VB's to audio RAM) can be
reclaimed and the heap can be set at the start of this RAM, and
grows down, set up via InitHeap.<br>
<br>
<h3>Replicating the Net Yaroze Siocons script.</h3>
<br>
Siocons is a DOS terminal program which interacts with the Net
Yaroze boot disc.<br>
It can mostly be automated by using a batch script file (typically
.sio or .bat) which loads data files to the PlayStation at
specific RAM addresses. Maintaining these addresses sequentially
and saving space is a pain and it's recommended that the siocons
script file be automatically generated using a tool like <a
moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://github.com/gwald/YOC">YOC</a>
which also creates a header file. <br>
<br>
This siocons script is also used by <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/gwald/Yarexe">yarexe</a> to package all
the files into a single PS-X executable file, which makes it
easier to run, burn etc.<br>
<br>
<p class="vspace">In a real Net Yaroze project, you would load
your data assets into RAM via the siocons script, in PSX.DEV the
debugger has to pre-loaded the assets into the correct RAM
address when pressing F5. This is done via the file in your
project folder: <br>
<b>.vscode\launch.json</b> </p>
<p class="vspace">You would add your assets a similar way to the
siocons script, ie: <br>
<br>
<b>local dload data\OPTIONS.TIM 0x801292E8 </b><b><br>
</b><b> local dload data\SWORD.TIM 0x8012A508 </b><b><br>
</b><b> local load main.exe </b><b><br>
</b><b> go </b></p>
In the <b>.vscode\launch.json</b> file, the <b>autorun</b>
section, the equivalent would be:
<pre class="escaped"><b>"restore data/OPTIONS.TIM binary 0x801292E8",
"restore data/SWORD.TIM binary 0x8012A508",
"load ${workspaceRootFolderName}.elf",
"tbreak main",
"continue"</b>
</pre>
Windows uses are recommended to use the Unix/Linux forward slash
also.<br>
<h3>Tips &amp; Notes<br>
</h3>
<p class="vspace">Psy-Q requires the libGS libraries to be
initialize with a GsInitGraph call <b>FIRST</b> before using
functions like FntLoad.<br>
</p>
<p class="vspace">Modern GCC is very strict, make sure all your
functions that return a value, does returns a value.<br>
</p>
<p class="vspace">Both FntPrint and KanjiFntPrint prototypes were
empty<u> </u>in libps.h this was incorrect and are correctly
defined as:<br>
int FntPrint(int id, char *, ...);<br>
int KanjiFntPrint(int id, char *, ...);<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3 class="vspace">Support<br>
</h3>
<p class="vspace">The Psy-Q to Net Yaroze glue (psyq_to_netyaroze)
is still Work In Progress.<br>
There are a few things missing or not working, these are
typically:<br>
</p>
<p class="vspace">1) Compiler built-in functions (exit, abort,
etc) - If you come across a C language function that doesn't
work, test it in the Psy-Q Cube demo to verify it works first,
if it doesn't work or is wrongly defined, then it could be a <a
moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/pcsx-redux/nugget">Psy-Q conversion</a>
issue;</p>
<p class="vspace">2) or Net Yaroze only helper functions like
TestCard, GetPadBuf and not found in Psy-Q.<br>
