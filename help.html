PSX.Dev Visual Studio Code Extension</h2>

<p><br>The <a href="https://psx.dev" target="_blank" class="urllink" rel="nofollow">PSX.Dev</a>
community have extracted the original Sony PSX SDK libraries and made them
usable with a modern GCC compiler and debugger (called <a href="https://www.psx.dev/getting-started psyq">PSYQ
+ nugget </a>).
<br>They are also maintaining the PS1 emulator <a href="https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux" target="_blank" class="urllink" rel="nofollow">PCSX-REDUX</a>
which also allows GDB to step through code. And they have combined all
these projects into a simple Visual Studio code extension.

<p class="vspace">The Net Yaroze SDK being a reduced subset version of
the professional PSYQ SDK, it is therefore relatively simple to create
a Net Yaroze compatible project.
<p>First install Visual Studio and the PSX.DEV extension by following the
most excellent video instructions to get started.

as per the video. Make sure it builds, runs and you can step debug correctly.
Installing clangd is also recommended.
<h2>
Installing Net Yaroze template.</h2>
This Net Yaroze template requires the Psy-Q and nugget tools, if you ran
the Psy-Q Cube demo, there's nothing else to install.
<br>The instructions are the same as per the Psy-Q Cube demo:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td>
<ol>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
In Visual Code, hit <b>CTRL + Shift + P</b>, select PSX.DEV Show panel,
click the TEMPLATES tab.</li>

<li>
Enter the name and path of your project and click the Psy-Q SDK tab, then
click create, in the Net Yaroze section, to create the new template project.</li>

<li>
The Net Yaroze template copies the Psy-Q SDK (libraries and headers) in
the project folder, with the modified <a href="https://github.com/gwald/psyq_to_netyaroze" moz-do-not-send="true">Net
Yaroze headers</a> and creates a demo program <a href="https://github.com/gwald/netyaroze_demo/blob/main/tutor/chap2/9/main.c" moz-do-not-send="true">originally
from here</a>. It should automatically load the new project into Visual
Code.</li>

<li>
Now we are ready to run and debug, Hit <b>CTRL + Shift + P</b> and select
<b>PSX.DEV:
Build Debug</b>, it should build correctly with no warnings or errors,
and a XXX.ps-exe file, (where XXX is your project name) should have been
created.</li>

<li>
Hit <b>CTRL + Shift + P</b> again and select <b>PSX.Dev: Launch PCSX-Redux</b>,
this will launch the emulator but it will not start.</li>

<li>
Return to Visual Code and hit <b>F5</b> to start the debugger, step over
a few lines and loop through the <i>while( !DONE )</i> loop, put a break
point after the <b>if( PAD_PRESS(buffer1,PAD_UP) )</b> line at<b> sprite.y
-=5;</b>&nbsp; about line 86.</li>

<li>
Next click run, to return to the step debugger, simply hit the up button
on the controller.</li>

<li>
Close the emulator to stop debugging.</li>

Found issues with Psy-Q Nugget library.</h2>
&nbsp;
<h3>
<b>Hierarchical node parenting doesn't work.</b></h3>
Using the <b>GsCOORDINATE2</b> field <b>super</b> which is used to set
the parent node doesn't work. It will not display parented objects or display
with screwed projection.
<br>To fix it requires recreating the psy-q nugget libraries, a newly created
libgs.a file is located in your third_party/net-yaroze folder, to use it,
in your makefile just add this location as a library source, with the -L
option like this:

<h2>
Replicating the Net Yaroze Siocons script.</h2>
Siocons is a DOS terminal program which can send and receive data from
the Net Yaroze after it has load the Net Yaroze boot disc.
<br>It can mostly be automated by using a batch script file (typically
.sio, .auto or .bat) which loads data files to the PlayStation at specific
RAM addresses. Maintaining these addresses sequentially and saving space
is a pain so it's recommended that the siocons script file be automatically
generated using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/gwald/YOC" moz-do-not-send="true">YOC</a>
which also creates a header file.
<p>This siocons script is also used by <a href="https://github.com/gwald/Yarexe" moz-do-not-send="true">yarexe</a>
to package all the files into a single PS-X executable file, which makes
it easier to run in emulation, or send to a real PlayStation or burn etc.

<p class="vspace">In a real Net Yaroze project, you would load your files
into RAM via the siocons script, in PSX.DEV the debugger has to pre-loaded
the assets into the correct RAM address when pressing F5.
<div class="vspace">This is done via <b>.vscode\launch.json</b> in your
project folder.</div>

<div class="vspace">You would add your assets a similar way to the siocons
script, ie:</div>

<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH="576" HEIGHT="120" >
<caption><tbody>

<br><b>local dload data\SWORD.TIM 0x8012A508&nbsp;</b>
<br>local load y3d.ps-exe
<br>go</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the <b>.vscode\launch.json</b> file, the <b>autorun</b> section,
the above equivalent would be:

&nbsp;]</pre>
</td>

</table>

<p><a href="https://github.com/gwald/YOC" moz-do-not-send="true">YOC</a>&nbsp;
can manage this list, all you have to do is insert your yoc_vscode.sio

<b>Reading Net Yaroze boot disc data.</b></h2>

<div class="vspace">The <a href="https://archive.org/details/net-yaroze-cip2.2-boot-disc-exe-cart-rom" moz-do-not-send="true">Net
Yaroze boot disc</a> has a few generic assets that can be load and used
in your games.</div>

<p><br>And contrary to common belief, the Net Yaroze SDK can read data
files from the CDROM.
<br>On a real Net Yaroze PlayStation, it can only be official PlayStation
CDROM's, which basically means the Net Yaroze boot disc, which does come
with a few useful game ready assets. But with a chipped PlayStation or
emulator it can read any PlayStation formatted CDROM.

<p class="vspace">Quick description of the file types:

<p class="vspace">.TIM&nbsp; - Image format, after loading the TIM into
VRAM, the RAM space can be reused.
<br>.SEQ - Music sequence, similar to the midi format, and must stay in
RAM to play.
<br>.VB&nbsp; - Voice Bank, sampled audio, after loading the VB file into
Audio RAM, the RAM space can be reused.
<br>.VH&nbsp; - VB index information, must remain in RAM to work.

<h2>
Changing the linker settings.</h2>
Technically speaking, this step is not required as it doesn't require the
Net Yaroze LibPS.exe in RAM for dynamic linking and running. The ps-exe
files are statically link.
<br>However if you want to be 100% completely Net Yaroze compatible (and
not cheat!) this RAM space must not be used at all.
<p>The Net Yaroze linker setting are defined typically like:
<br><b>-Xlinker -Ttext -Xlinker 80090000</b>
<p>Where 0x80090000 is the RAM location that the Net Yaroze executable
would be typically loaded to.
<p>In PSX.DEV the default is 0x80010000 (PSX RAM address range is from
0x80010000 to 0x801FFFFF).
<br>Loading at 0x80010000 is a problem for Net Yaroze programs because
that's the location of the Net Yaroze libps.exe file (like a DLL which
makes executables smaller to transfer over serial - See Memory Map in the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/net-yaroze-documents/020-1997-userguide/page/38/mode/1up" moz-do-not-send="true">Net
Yaroze User Guide PDF</a>).
<br>We need to change it to the first RAM available to us, which is after
libps.exe, 0x80090000 (loaded low).
<br>To do this with PSX.DEV's GCC, add this line as the first LDFLAGS line
in the makefile:
<br><b>LDFLAGS=-Xlinker --defsym=TLOAD_ADDR=0x80090000</b>
<p>But the executable can be loaded anywhere in the PlayStation's RAM.
For example the executable can be loaded after the assets or data files,
loaded higher in RAM.
<p>Please note: The Net Yaroze executable will always be alot smaller than
a PSY-Q link executable which will be a lot bigger because it will include
the linked libraries in the executable. This change will effect your siocons
script IF your data is loaded after the executable (loaded low in RAM).
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<h2>
Reusing asset RAM.</h2>
If you only load your assets once in your program (which is typical for
Net Yaroze) and you organize your files correctly, then after they have
been copied to their respective places ie TIM's to video RAM and VB's to
audio RAM and initialized correctly, their original RAM space can then
be reclaimed by your program for anything, ie dynamically created game
data etc or by initializing the heap (via InitHeap) to start at the top
of this RAM space (which then grows upwards).
<p>Obviously you can not reclaim RAM space of files that are still required
to be in RAM, ie TMD's.

<h3>
Debugging problems.</h3>

<p><br>#1 Check your path, make sure you are running the right tool and
version! It should always be using the PSX.Dev toolchain supplied applications.
<br>#2 Alway use the latest versions of the toolchain, libraries, emulator,
etc.

<h3>
Call GsInitGraph first!</h3>
Psy-Q requires the libGS libraries to be initialize with a GsInitGraph
call <b>FIRST</b> before using other libGS functions, in particular FntLoad
or GetPadBuf .</div>

<div class="vspace">Modern GCC can be very strict, make sure all your functions
that return a value, does return a value, this is especially true when

<h4>
C Language.</h4>

<p><br>The default lanaguage is C++, if you want to use C, edit your makefile
in your project like the following.
<p>Above the line :
<br>CPPFLAGS +=
<p>Add the C standard you want, IE:
<br>CFLAGS += -std=c99
<p>And also rename:
<br>CPPFLAGS
<br>To just:
<br>CFLAGS

&nbsp;
<div class="vspace">While looking at the makefile, if you change the executable
extention, the default is ps-exe:
